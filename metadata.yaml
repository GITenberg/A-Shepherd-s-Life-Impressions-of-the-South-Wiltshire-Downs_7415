description: W. H. Hudson's frequent rambles around the English countryside resulted
  in several captivating travel narratives and helped inspire the back-to-nature movement
  of the 1920s and 1930s. A Shepherd's Life is a collection of Hudson's impressions
  of the land and people of the South Wiltshire Downs including the shepherds who
  roam the region with their flocks, their relationships with their dogs, and the
  hardship of everyday life.
